7. Let�s build our MERGE statement
BEGIN TRAN
MERGE INTO tblTransaction as T
USING tblTransactionNew as S
ON T.EmployeeNumber = S.EmployeeNumber AND T.DateOfTransaction = S.DateOfTransaction
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET Amount = T.Amount + S.Amount
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN
    INSERT ([Amount], [DateOfTransaction], [EmployeeNumber])
	VALUES (S.Amount, S.DateOfTransaction, S.EmployeeNumber);
ROLLBACK TRAN

-- tblTransaction (no) - tblTransactionNew (yes)
-- 1 tblTransaction - 1 tblTransactionNew
-- 1 tblTransaction - multiple rows TblTransactionNew
8.  Let�s expand our MERGE statement
SELECT DateOfTransaction, EmployeeNumber, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfRows
FROM tblTransactionNew 
GROUP BY DateOfTransaction, EmployeeNumber
HAVING COUNT(*)>1

BEGIN TRAN
go
DISABLE TRIGGER TR_tblTransaction ON dbo.tblTransaction
GO
MERGE INTO tblTransaction as T
USING (SELECT DateOfTransaction, EmployeeNumber, MIN(Amount) as Amount
      FROM tblTransactionNew
	  GROUP BY DateOfTransaction, EmployeeNumber) as S
ON T.EmployeeNumber = S.EmployeeNumber AND
	T.DateOfTransaction = S.DateOfTransaction
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET Amount = T.Amount + S.Amount
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
	INSERT (Amount, DateOfTransaction, EmployeeNumber)
	VALUES (S.Amount, S.DateOfTransaction, S.EmployeeNumber)
	OUTPUT deleted.*, inserted.*;
ROLLBACK TRAN
9. Merge with additional column
BEGIN TRAN
ALTER TABLE tblTransaction
ADD Comments varchar(50) NULL
GO -- DDL
MERGE TOP (5) PERCENT INTO tblTransaction as T --DML
USING (select EmployeeNumber, DateOfTransaction, sum(Amount) as Amount

WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN

OUTPUT inserted.*, deleted.* , $action;
--Select * from tblTransaction ORDER BY EmployeeNumber, DateOfTransaction
ROLLBACK TRAN
11. Let�s create our first procedure
create proc NameEmployees as
begin
	select EmployeeNumber, EmployeeFirstName, EmployeeLastName
	from tblEmployee
end
go
NameEmployees
execute NameEmployees
exec NameEmployees
12. Ask for a specific employee
--if exists (select * from sys.procedures where name='NameEmployees')
if object_ID('NameEmployees','P') IS NOT NULL
drop proc NameEmployees
go
create proc NameEmployees(@EmployeeNumber int) as
begin
	if exists (Select * from tblEmployee where EmployeeNumber = @EmployeeNumber)
	begin
		select EmployeeNumber, EmployeeFirstName, EmployeeLastName

	end
end
go
NameEmployees 4
execute NameEmployees 223
exec NameEmployees 323
select EmployeeNumber from NameEmployees

DECLARE @EmployeeName int = 123
select @EmployeeName
13. Different outcomes
--if exists (select * from sys.procedures where name='NameEmployees')
if object_ID('NameEmployees','P') IS NOT NULL
drop proc NameEmployees
go
create proc NameEmployees(@EmployeeNumber int) as
begin

			select * from tblTransaction where EmployeeNumber = @EmployeeNumber
		end
	end
end
go
NameEmployees 4
execute NameEmployees 223

14. Ask for a range of employees
--if exists (select * from sys.procedures where name='NameEmployees')

drop proc NameEmployees
go
create proc NameEmployees(@EmployeeNumberFrom int, @EmployeeNumberTo int) as

	end
end
go
NameEmployees 4, 5
execute NameEmployees 223, 227
exec NameEmployees @EmployeeNumberFrom = 323, @EmployeeNumberTo = 327
15. A different SELECT statement per employee
--if exists (select * from sys.procedures where name='NameEmployees')
if object_ID('NameEmployees','P') IS NOT NULL
drop proc NameEmployees
go
create proc NameEmployees(@EmployeeNumberFrom int, @EmployeeNumberTo int) as

			SET @EmployeeNumber = @EmployeeNumber + 1
		END
	end
end
go
NameEmployees 4, 5
execute NameEmployees 223, 227
exec NameEmployees @EmployeeNumberFrom = 323, @EmployeeNumberTo = 1327
16. Returning values

drop proc NameEmployees
